# Harbour Traffic
Victoria's Inner Harbour is a beautiful and bustling working harbour that serves as an entry into downtown for hundreds of thousands each year by ferry and seaplane. Downtown Victoria also benefits from cruise ships which dock just outside of downtown at Ogden Point. All of which contributes to downtown Victoria's vibrant economy. 

## Seaplanes
[Harbour Air](http://www.harbourair.com) provide service to and from Vancouver, South Vancouver, Whistler, and Pitt Meadows on its fleet of 34 seaplanes. [Kenmore Air](http://www.kenmoreair.com) provides service to Seattle, WA aboard a 45 minute flight. Combined, these two companies provide flights for 350,000 people in our harbour each year.

## Ferries
[Black Ball Ferry Line](https://www.cohoferry.com) provides service aboard the passenger and vehicle ferry, MV Coho and sees 120,000 vehicles and 400,000 passengers a year. The 90 minute trip crosses the Strait of Juan de Fuca and transports passengers to and from Port Angeles, WA.

[Clipper Navigation](http://www.clippervacations.com) provides service to Seattle aboard one of two passenger only high-speed catamarans. The three hour trip from Seattle ventures through the Puget Sound and into the Strait of Juan de Fuca as it makes its way to Victoria.

## Cruise Ships
Victoria also [welcomes cruise ships](http://victoriacuise.ca) with 229 ship calls carrying 513,000 passengers arriving in 2015 at Ogden Point just outside of the downtown core.

The cruise industry makes up a large part of the tourism economy in Victoria. Ships begin docking at Ogden Point in April of each year and the cruise season continues until early October. Last year, the cruise industry was a strong year bringing millions into Victoria and 2015 includes more and longer port visits.
