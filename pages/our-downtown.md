# Our Downtown

Downtown Victoria is steeped in history and heritage, with an abundance of charming historic buildings, complemented with contemporary structures.  We are a dynamic, expanding core with booming tech, tourism, and cultural industries which are supplemented by a rapidly growing residential population.  Many cultures mingle in Downtown Victoria, and we celebrate our aboriginal heritage, our British founders, and the oldest Chinatown in Canada.  Downtown Victoria is a place where you could write code in the morning, run alongside the ocean during lunch break, have a full High Tea in the afternoon, and enjoy a local craft beer in while watching a live performance in the evening, if it suits your tastes. If you are contemplating an investment in Victoria&nbsp;–&nbsp;whatever your business&nbsp;–&nbsp;we have a space for you in Downtown Victoria.
