**Have you been wondering why there have been New York City police cars and Big Apple cabs around Victoria’s downtown this spring?**

The vehicles were used in the filming of Air Bud Entertainment’s feature film *Monkey Up!*, just one of the 10 film productions completed in the area by the end of April. Other projects included Hallmark television movies *Last Resort* and *Gourmet Detective 2*, and feature films such as Lakeshore Entertainment’s *The Boy* and Wes Craven’s *The Girl in the Photographs*.

Given that 2006 — the best year on record with an approximate direct spend of $18 million — saw 12 visiting productions over the entire year, 2015 could set a new benchmark. According to Kathleen Gilbert, film commissioner at the [Vancouver Island South Film & Media Commission](http://www.filmvictoria.com/), the area’s exclusion from the Distant Tax Credit, introduced in 2008, caused the annual spend to drop to an average of $7 million.

Provincial tax incentives announced in February 2014 and the weaker Canadian dollar are responsible for the area’s recent surge in visiting productions.

“We were up by $3 million last year, bringing direct spending to around $10 million in 2014… and this year, we’re expecting it to be back up to around $18 million, as long as it continues on like this.”
