Victoria is introducing a number of new waste bins on downtown streets to promote recycling.

The new waste bins have separate compartments for recyclables, food waste and garbage.

Sixteen bins are being installed throughout downtown on a trial basis, and will remain in place until October.

The city will track the volume, type of materials collected and the amount of cross-contamination and then make recommendations on whether to expand the program in 2016.

Nine of the new bins will be placed along Government Street between Fort and Wharf streets, four at the intersection of Blanshard and Fort streets, two near the entrance to Chinatown, and one along the Dallas waterfront road trail near Cook Street.
